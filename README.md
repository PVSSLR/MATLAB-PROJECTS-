# RC PLANE CALCULATOR USING MATLAB 

RC plane calculator using matlab GUIDE

## Getting Started

By using the wing span we can calculate various parameters like fuselage length, wing area, wing cord, wing thicknes, surface area of horizontal and vertical sabilizer, center of gravity for trainer and delta wing aircraft
