function varargout = RC_Design(varargin)
% RC_DESIGN MATLAB code for RC_Design.fig
%      RC_DESIGN, by itself, creates a new RC_DESIGN or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = RC_DESIGN returns the handle to a new RC_DESIGN or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      RC_DESIGN('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in RC_DESIGN.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      RC_DESIGN('Property','Value',...) creates a new RC_DESIGN or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before RC_Design_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to RC_Design_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
